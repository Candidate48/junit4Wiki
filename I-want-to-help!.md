It's encouraging how many people come by the github site or mailing list who just say "I love JUnit, how can I help"?  If you have a specific idea, please come by the mailing list at junit@yahoogroups.com, and let's chat about it.

## Getting Started

If you're just wanting to contribute some time, here's some ways to get started:

- Find an issue to work on.  Start with the issues [labeled lowhanging](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues?direction=asc&labels=lowhanging&page=1&sort=updated&state=open), which are tasks that we have explicitly guessed are unlikely to get bogged down in project controversy or design debates.

- If nothing looks reasonable there, go all through the [issues](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues?direction=asc&sort=updated&state=open), and see if there's any that tickle your fancy.  I'd strongly recommend pinging the issue with a little "hey, is this a good idea" before digging in--we will see it, and usually respond quickly.

- We're still catching up with documentation at [the wiki](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki).  If there's anything you can think of to add ([Getting started](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Getting-started) could use some pointers to "next steps", for example), that might help the community more than additional code.

## Making Pull Requests

The basic steps for creating a pull request are explained in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). More difficult parts of pull requests are documented at the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Pull-Requests) wiki page.
