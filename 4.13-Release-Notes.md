# Assertions

### [Pull request #1054:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1054) Improved error message for `assertArrayEquals` when multi-dimensional arrays have different lengths

Previously, JUnit's assertion error message would indicate only that some array lengths _x_ and _y_ were unequal, without indicating whether this pertained to the outer array or some nested array. Now, in case of a length mismatch between two nested arrays, Junit will tell at which indices they reside.

# Test Runners

### [Pull request #1037:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1037) `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner#createTest` now accepts `FrameworkMethod`

Subclasses of `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner` can now produce a custom test object based on the `FrameworkMethod` test being executed by implementing the new `createTest(FrameworkMethod)` method. The default implementation calls the existing `createTest()` method.

#Rules

### [Pull request #1044:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1044) Strict verification of resource deletion in `TemporaryFolder` rule

Previously `TemporaryFolder` rule did not fail the test if some temporary resources
could not be deleted. With this change a new `assuredDeletion` parameter is introduced
which will fail the test with `AssertionError`, if resource deletion fails. The default
behavior of `TemporaryFolder` is unchanged. 
This feature must be enabled by creating `TemporaryFolder` using the `TemporaryFolder.builder()`
method:
```java
@Rule public TemporaryFolder folder = TemporaryFolder.builder().assureDeletion().build();
```
