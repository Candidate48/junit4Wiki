# Plain-old JAR

Download one of the following JARs from our [GitHub downloads page](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads):

* `junit.jar`: Includes the Hamcrest classes. The simple all-in-one solution to get started quickly.
* `junit-dep.jar`: Only includes the JUnit classes but not Hamcrest. Let's you use a different Hamcrest version.
* `junit-src.jar`: The sources for JUnit.

To use one of those JARs simply put them on your test classpath.

In addition there is a complete ZIP file that includes all of the above JARs along with Javadoc for JUnit and Hamcrest.

# Maven

Add a dependency to `junit:junit` in `test` scope.
