## Removal of deprecated code

### [Pull request #1049:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1049) JUnit4ClassRunner

`JUnit4ClassRunner` was deprecated in JUnit 4.3 (more than six years and 10 releases ago) with a comment saying "This may disappear as soon as 1 April 2009". We started having some problems with running the tests in JDK 7, and we decided to delete the class and its support classes. Although we try very hard to, `JUnit4ClassRunner` didn't support `Rule`s, it wasn't designed to be extensible, and it was in an internal package. Please use `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner` instead.

### [Pull request #1047:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1047) Deprecated Hamcrest matchers

Hamcrest matchers in `JUnitMatchers` that have been deprecated since 4.11 have been deleted. Please use their replacements in `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers` (see hamcrest-core).
