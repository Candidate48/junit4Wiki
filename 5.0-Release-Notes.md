## JDK 6

### [#1064:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1064) Update JUnit to compile targeting JDK 6

JDK 5 reached end of life in October of 2009. In order to use APIs introduced in JDK 6, e.g. `ServiceLoader`, JUnit now requires JDK 6.

## Removal of deprecated code

### [#1049:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1049) JUnit4ClassRunner

`JUnit4ClassRunner` was deprecated in JUnit 4.3 (more than six years and 10 releases ago) with a comment saying "This may disappear as soon as 1 April 2009". We started having some problems with running the tests in JDK 7, and we decided to delete the class and its support classes. Although we try very hard to, `JUnit4ClassRunner` didn't support `Rule`s, it wasn't designed to be extensible, and it was in an internal package. Please use `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner` instead.

### [#1047:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1047) Deprecated Hamcrest matchers

Hamcrest matchers in `JUnitMatchers` that have been deprecated since 4.11 have been deleted. Please use their replacements in `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers` (see hamcrest-core).
