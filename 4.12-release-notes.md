(As new features get added to 4.12, please link commits or pull requests here with a short description of the change.)

##### [Pull request #542](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/542): Customized failure message in `ExceptionRule`

`ExceptionRule` now allows one to customize the failure message thrown when the test does not throw the expected exception. For example example:
```
thrown.reportMissingExceptionWithMessage("FAIL: Expected exception to be thrown");
```
If a custom failure message is not provided a default message is used.

##### [Pull request #529](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/529): `@DataPoints`-annotated methods can now yield `null` values

Up until JUnit 4.11 a `@DataPoints`-annotated array field could contain `null` values, but the array returned by a `@DataPoints`-annotated methods could not. This asymmetry has been resolved: _both_ can now provide a `null` data point.
