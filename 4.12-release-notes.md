(As new features get added to 4.12, please link commits or pull requests here with a short description of the change.)

### [Pull request #542:](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/542) Customized failure message for `ExceptionRule`

`ExceptionRule` now allows one to customize the failure message thrown when the test does not throw the expected exception. For example example:
```
thrown.reportMissingExceptionWithMessage("FAIL: Expected exception to be thrown");
```
If a custom failure message is not provided a default message is used.

### [Pull request #549:](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/549) `@DataPoints`-annotated methods can now yield `null` values

Up until JUnit 4.11 a `@DataPoints`-annotated array field could contain null values, but the array returned by a `@DataPoints`-annotated method could not. This asymmetry has been resolved: _both_ can now provide a `null` data point. 

### [Pull request #544:](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/544) New constructor and factories in `Timeout`

`Timeout` deprecated the old constructor `Timeout(int millis)`.
A new constructor is available `TimeUnit(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`. It enables you to use more confortable time units like `NANOSECONDS`, `MICROSECONDS`, `MILLISECONDS`, and `SECONDS`. Examples:

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = new Timeout(50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);`

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = new Timeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);`

and factory methods in `Timeout`:

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = Timeout.millis(50);`

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = Timeout.seconds(10);`

This usage avoids the truncation, which was the problem in the deprecated constructor `Timeout(int millis)` when casting long to integer.
