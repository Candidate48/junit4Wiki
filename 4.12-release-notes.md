### Customized failure message in `ExceptionRule`
`ExceptionRule` also provides the capability to customize the failure message thrown if the test does not throw the expected exception. An example:

`thrown.reportMissingExceptionWithMessage("FAIL: Expected exception to be thrown");`

If a custom failure message is not provided a default one is used.
