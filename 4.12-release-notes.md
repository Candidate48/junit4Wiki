### Customized failure message in `ExceptionRule`
`ExceptionRule` also provides the capability to customize the failure message thrown if the test does not throw the expected exception. An example:

`thrown.reportMissingExceptionWithMessage("FAIL: Expected exception to be thrown");`

If a custom failure message is not provided a default one is used.

### New constructor and factories in `Timeout`
`Timeout`deprecated the old constructor `Timeout(int millis)`.
A new constructor is available `TimeUnit(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`. It enables you to use more confortable time units like `NANOSECONDS`, `MICROSECONDS`, `MILLISECONDS`, and `SECONDS`.


Few examples with new constructor of Timeout:

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = new Timeout(50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);`

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = new Timeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);`

and factory methods in Timeout:

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = Timeout.millis(50);`

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = Timeout.seconds(10);`

This usage avoids the truncation, which was the problem in the deprecated constructor Timeout(int millis) when casting long to integer.
