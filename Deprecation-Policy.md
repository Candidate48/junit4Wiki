From version 4.12 on JUnit follows the principles of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). 

## Guidelines

- An existing API can be deprecated in both major and minor releases.
- Deprecated APIs will only be removed in major releases and not before one year has passed since the release in which they were first deprecated.
